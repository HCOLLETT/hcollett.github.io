I make things. Primarily for myself, by myself. The reality that I have come to understand is that nobody cares about you, your dreams, and your ambitions, nearly as much as you do. Where I have found that I personally deviate from the masses is in the area of self reliance. In short, everyone wants to be able to turn thoughts into reality, few have the ability to. I consider myself extremely fortunate to be part of the few that do.
