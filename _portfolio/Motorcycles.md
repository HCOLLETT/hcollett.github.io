  I'm going to keep this brief. I love all kinds of machines, cars, drones, nuclear reactors... but there's something in a motorcycle that just does something a little extra. If I didnt enjoy making stuff so much, I'd probably pack a bag and ride around for the rest of forever, but the harsh reality is, and this is a reoccuring theme, I enjoy making bikes more than I enjoy riding all day. The only place I want to go is to my shop, and when you start at your shop, it just seems like an extra step.
  I could list out every way that I've worked on a motorcycle, but it would be easier to list what I haven't done.          . There's the list.

I know that sounds hyperbolic, but it's closer to the truth than not. I've had bikes into all of their pieces, custom wiring harnesses, laced rear hubs to front rims, rebuilt carbs, upholsterd seats, rebuilt whole engines, rebuilt forks, I even put on some edgy stickers. Now I dont claim to be a mechanic, and you won't catch me working on sombody else's bike, but my knowledge base in area of mechanics rest firmly on the cornerstone of building bikes. I am beliver in this simple principle, all forms of making are relitivly similar. I follow this simple process of dream, design, execute, analyze, and then I repeat it until I have arrived at my desired outcome.
