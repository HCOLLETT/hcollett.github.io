  I'm not going to say this is where It all started. However, without my leather business, I wouldn't be nearly where I am today. A large portion of the skillsets and tools that I posess have come from my desire to improve the quality of my work here. Whether it be website development, graphic design, product design, manufactuing processes, all of the software that goes with those disciplines, or just the discipline it takes to be relentlesness in striving for something better, every aspect of my being has been shaped by the running down this particular dream.

In 2017, I started making leather goods while I was studying Engineering at the University of Georgia. I was going broke trying to build motorcycles in college, and it seemed like a perfectly reasonable idea at the time to start a business to help offset some of those cost. Little did I know at the time, that whatever money I thought I was spending on parts would pale in comparison to the amount of money that would get invested into H+S. What started off as a couple of hand tools in the kitchen, has turned into a full blown workshop. Thanks to H+S we have been able to expand our scope envelope to include carpentry, metal fabrication, additive manufacturing, rapid prototyping, mechatronic serviceing, and most recently, small scale CNC milling. To be completely fair, leatherwork has taken a backseat lately, a real cart leading the horse type situation, but when your cart is a racecar, the horse is just there to enjoy the ride.
